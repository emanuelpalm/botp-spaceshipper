This is a game designed to be played by AIs rather than humans. In particular, it is meant to be played by chatbots.
You produce suitable prompts from the state of the game world, including the position of your player and a target to
take it to, provide it to an LLM, which then gives you an acceleration vector (ax, ay) back that is then sent to the
game server.
